# SimConnect Server for use with SimToolkitPro

Serialises data from ESP based simulators for use over IPC or network broadcast with SimToolkitPro.

Looking to improve support for Microsoft Flight Simulator and general improvements and reliability currently.

# Setup

Currently it is built against .Net framework 2.0 for backwards compatbility and uses the SimConnect reference from the XPack version of Microsoft Flight Simulator X. The aim is to maintain support for older simulators as well as the latest release, it is also restricted to an x86 build for those reasons.
